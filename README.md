# NOTE:
This entire branch is not supposed to be the actual installer and is meant to be a shitpost of sorts. AKA **__DON'T USE THIS VERSION OF THE INSTALLER__**,
If you want to use the actual version of the installer, go [here](https://github.com/BL00DY-C0D3/Echo-VR-Installer/releases)

That being said, I wrote this purely for giggles.
The whole point of this installer is that it will play (fake) advertisments after everything you do, it can still install echo, just in a really annoying way

I don't plan to update this at all, because it was purely for fun.
